# HomeAutomation
The beginnings of my homeautomation
**Update** 2018-04-07 - shortly after I started this I found [home-assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), which runs on a RasPi and does a whole lot more than I originally imagined so I'll be leaving this behind and using that.

## Classes
### quickweather
A wrapper class for weather-api to make it refreshable and easier to interact with.

## Scripts
* [determine-rain-delay](bin/determine-rain-delay.py) - script using quickweather to determine if we need to set a rain delay

#### Special Thanks
* [shollingsworth](https://github.com/shollingsworth) - I used your work/examples/scripts for packaging
